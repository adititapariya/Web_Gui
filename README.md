# WEB GUI <br>
Web GUI, which stands for Web Graphical User Interface, is a user interface designed to facilitate interaction with a robot. It aims to provide an intuitive and accessible interface enabling users to operate and manage the robot's functions effectively. It offers a versatile user interface that allows users to manually and autonomously control robots. Users can operate the robot manually by directly controlling its movements and mechanisms through the interface. Moreover, it facilitates autonomous navigation where users can guide the robot to autonomously cover the designated area by inputting the destination location through the interface. This interface communicates this location to the robot's control system, typically powered by a Raspberry Pi, and provides real-time feedback on the distance between the robot's current location and the destination. This comprehensive functionality empowers users to seamlessly switch between manual and autonomous control. It also includes a separate window for displaying real-time video from a stereo camera, providing visual feedback on the robot's surroundings. It also utilizes the camera to detect waste types, displaying resulting images in a detection section. The collected waste data, including category percentages, is organized and presented in a data analysis section. It additionally displays crucial data regarding the robot's operation. This includes information such as the robot's location and orientation. It provides user-friendly features to control various mechanisms, such as collection, vibration, conveyor movement, and segregation. Web GUI enables users to effectively monitor and manage the robot's operation, ensuring smooth and efficient performance of the robot in various scenarios.
